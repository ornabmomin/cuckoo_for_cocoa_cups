My name is Natasha Greenblatt. I am an artist, writer and theatre maker. Recently I have been self-medicating with hot chocolate as I attempt to surive motherhood. Follow my descent into madness.

## Cherry Bomb

The first word that comes to mind is "servicable", although like so many things these days my attention and ability to enjoy things were diminished.

I was accompanied by my pregnant friend, who lives around the corner from Cherry Bomb. Her and her partner are regular customers there, often starting their day with a coffee and a delectable pastry. Although I very much enjoy their pastry, and have many times gone on record stating that Cherry Bomb makes the best croissants in the city, I decided against bringing anything back for my partner who may have appreciated it. Curious.

Anyways, back to the hot chocolate. I didn't really get a chance to try it because my baby began to cry. I stopped to nurse her outside. A pair of Polish women stopped to express their concern for my bare breast (it was 5Â°C outside, my boob was fine). By the time I returned to my hot chocolate, it was no longer hot.

In the end, although the hot chocolate did not blow my mind, the experience going to Cherry Bomb is always nice. Will be going back!
